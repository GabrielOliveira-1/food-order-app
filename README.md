## Introduction

The Food Order App is a web application built using React that allows users to browse a menu of food items, add items to their cart, and proceed with their order. It incorporates various important React concepts and features to create a seamless user experience.

## Key Concepts

### React Components

The app is structured into reusable React components, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Adding Items

Users can add food items to their cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button. This involves managing the state of the cart.

### Removing Items

Items can be removed from the cart, which also updates the cart state accordingly.

### Displaying Items

The selected food items in the cart are displayed to the user, providing a summary of their order.

### Forms and Form Inputs

Forms and form inputs are used for user interactions, such as adding items to the cart and submitting orders.

### Cart Components

It contains components related to the cart, like the cart icon, cart sidebar, cart item list, and cart item display components, which are implemented.

### Modal Components

Modal components are used for displaying additional information or interactions, such as confirming the order.

### React Portal

React Portals are used to render modals outside their parent components to ensure proper layering in the DOM.

### Cart State

The state of the cart is managed using React's state management system.

### Modal State

The state of modals (open/closed) is controlled to manage their visibility.

### Cart Reducer

A reducer is used to manage cart-related actions and updates.

### Cart Context

React context is employed to provide cart state and actions to components without prop drilling.

### Refs and Forward Refs

Refs and forward refs may be used for accessing and interacting with DOM elements when necessary.
